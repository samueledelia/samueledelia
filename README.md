# Hi there, i'm Samuele ðŸ˜Š

I'm a mathematical engineer with a passion for Mathematics and Finance. I've gained experience as a quantitative analyst in the energy trading sector and as a model validator in banking. I'm eager to further develop my skills in advanced programming for scientific computing, option pricing, and risk management.

Always curious and driven, Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and growing in the field of quantitative finance.
